abstract = {Abstract. Although Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has become popular in recent years, the majority of legacy systems are still not SOA enabled. The increase in the amount of information that companies must handle has resulted in a considerable increase in the complexity of the legacy systems that store this information. While moving to a serviceoriented architecture platform can help in handling this increase, at the same time it is important to preserve the investment of many years of tuning and debugging of the legacy assets as much as possible. Several techniques exist for modernizing legacy systems towards service-oriented architecture. In this paper we present a survey of the various approaches to moving legacy systems to the SOA environment. We discuss the various approaches and methods and highlight their strengths and weaknesses, with an eye to assisting the decision process when undertaking a new modernization project.},

migrating core legacy applications towards Web-enabled client-server

from a migration project aimed at integrating an existing COBOL system

decomposed into its user interface and server (application logic and

The server component has been wrapped with dynamic load libraries

abstract = {Integrating legacy Cobol systems into a Web-based architecture is a complex and challenging task. Cobol is not a distributed and object-oriented language, however its integration with other languages or distributed systems is a prerequisite for achieving migration towards Web technologies. Moreover, the user interface and user interaction modalities need to be changed. Numerous strategies have been proposed for wrapping the business logic and re-implementing the user interface, but there is still a great need for experimental research. This paper presents a migration strategy whose target system is a Web-enabled architecture based on the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. By extracting all the needed information from the Cobol source code, the realized toolkit can automatically generate wrappers for the business logic and the data model and the Web user interface as Java server pages. The strategy and the toolkit presented have been defined within the project M\&amp;S SW, a research project aimed at defining new technological solutions to be transferred to small and medium enterprises operating in information and communication technologies.},

abstract = {A solution to the problem of salvaging the past investments in centralized, mainframe-oriented software development, while keeping competitive in the dynamic business world, consists of migrating legacy systems towards more modern environments, in particular client-server platforms. However, a migration process entails costs and risks that depend on the characteristics of both the architecture of the source system and the target client-server platform. We propose an approach to program decomposition as a preliminary step for the migration of legacy systems. A program slicing algorithm is defined to identify the statements implementing the user interface component. An interactive re-engineering tool is also presented that supports the software engineer in the comprehension of the source code during the decomposition of a program. The focus of this paper is on the partition of a legacy system, while issues related to the re-engineering, encapsulation, and wrapping of the legacy components and to the definition of the middleware layer through which they communicate are not tackled.},

abstract = {With the advent and widespread use of object-oriented and client–server technologies, companies expect their legacy systems, developed for the centralized environment, to take advantage of these new technologies and also cooperate with their heterogeneous environments. An alternative to migrating legacy systems from the mainframe to a user-centered, distributed object computing, and client–server platform is to wrap the legacy systems on the mainframe and expose the interfaces of the legacy systems to the remote clients. The enabling middleware technologies such as Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Component Object Model/Distributed Component Object Model (COM/DCOM), and Java \{RMI\} make the migration of the legacy systems to a heterogeneous distributed computing environment possible. In this paper, we present an approach and practical experience for integrating the legacy systems to a heterogeneous distributed computing environment by adopting the \{CORBA\} technology. It has been reported quite often that an approach like this will improve system maintainability, portability, and interoperability. We also illustrate this approach with an industrial project. The project is viewed as a reengineering effort where a centralized reengineering system is wrapped to operate in a heterogeneous distributed computing environment by leveraging \{CORBA\} technology. The reengineering approach is a combination of redesign and simple facelift. The resulting legacy integration architecture through the application of the approach is evaluated using the equality attributes proposed by Bass, Clements, and Kazman. },

abstract = {An effective way of leveraging the value of legacy systems is to expose their functionality, or subsets of it, as services. In the business world, this has become a very popular approach because it allows underlying systems to remain largely unchanged, while exposing functionality to a larger number of clients through well-defined service interfaces. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is also adopting this approach by defining service-oriented architectures (SOAs) that include a set of infrastructure common services on which organizations can build additional domain services or applications. When legacy systems or components are to be used as the foundation for domain services, there must be an analysis of how to convert the functionality in existing systems into services. This analysis should consider the specific interactions that is required by the SOA and any changes that need to be made to the legacy components. We have recently helped an organization evaluate the potential for converting components of an existing system into services that would run in a new and tightly constrained DoD SOA environment. This paper describes the process that was used and outlines several issues that need to be addressed in making similar migrations},

The unique aspect of this migration is the reengineering of the COBOL code prior to migration. The programs were in their previous form hardwired to the AS400 screens as well as to the AS400 file system. The goal of the reengineering project was to free the code from these proprietary dependencies and to reduce them to the pure business logic. Disentangling legacy code from it's physical environment is a major prerequisite to converting that code to another environment. The goal is the virtualization of program interfaces. That was accomplished here in a multistep automated process which led to small, environment independent COBOL modules which could be readily converted over into Java packages. The pilot project has been completed for a sample subset of the production planning and control system. The conversion to Java is pending the test of the reengineered COBOL modules.},

abstract = { During the last three decades, a considerable amount of software has been developed based on obsolete technologies (such as using procedural languages). This type of systems has undergone severe code revisions during a long time period. As a consequence, the high level of entropy combined with imprecise documentation about the design and architecture make the maintenance more difficult, time consuming, and costly. On the other hand, these systems have important economical value; many of them are crucial to their owners (Bennett, 1995). For the high cost of lost former investment and business knowledge that embedded in those systems, in many cases, simply abandon legacy systems and re-develop new systems based on new technology is not the choice. Migrating legacy system toward new emerging technology is an appropriate solution. However, migrating legacy system towards new technology is a complex system engineering work. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reduce the migration complexity. We apply dynamic program analysis, software visualization, knowledge recovery, and divide-and-conquer techniques to cope with the complexity issue in legacy software migration project.},
