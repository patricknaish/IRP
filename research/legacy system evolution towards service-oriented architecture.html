<p>Although Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has become popular in recent years, the majority of legacy systems are still not SOA enabled. The increase in the amount of information that companies must handle has resulted in a considerable increase in the complexity of the legacy systems that store this information. While moving to a service-oriented architecture platform can help in handling this increase, at the same time it is important to preserve the investment of many years of tuning and debugging of the legacy assets as much as possible. Several techniques exist for modernizing legacy systems towards service-oriented architecture. In this paper we present a survey of the various approaches to moving legacy systems to the SOA environment. We discuss the various approaches and methods and highlight their strengths and weaknesses, with an eye to assisting the decision process when undertaking a new modernization project.</p>
