\section{Project Description}
This project will be an investigation into the existing and proposed tools and methodologies for migrating mainframe (or similar legacy system) applications to run under more modern systems, such as on PCs, distributed systems and/or web services. Assessing the usefulness of such tools and methodologies is important for making decisions on whether to attempt to recoup previously invested time and resources from existing systems, or invest again in a newer, more flexible version of said system. Therefore, the questions this project aims to answer are whether sufficient tools exist to facilitate code migration, whether there are standard (or at least widely accepted) methodologies in place for doing so, and whether such migrations turn out to be genuinely beneficial for the related parties.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To investigate tools and methodologies for migrating legacy code to current systems.
	\item To assess the efficacy of said tools and methodologies in migrating code.
	\item To investigate the effect of migrating code on the performance of migrated applications.
	\item To assess the financial benefits or detriments of migrating a legacy system rather than creating an entirely new one.
\end{itemize}
